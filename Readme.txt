In this project we simply wanted to classify that if there is a tumor in the brain or not we did not go into the specifics which will tell the type of the tumor.
We also cross tested this and the accuracy diff and loss diff was very minor meaning it was not over fit rather the model has generalized.
The dataset which we used were from kaggle for both training and for cross validation.
